# ES6 Node.js

A basic node.js project that is set up to allow ES6 syntax.

## Why?

The `npx express-generator` generates a project filled with a lot of folders and files that you might end up deleting because you don't need them.

This project is for those that prefer to use ES6 syntax and just want a simple node.js project.

## Usage

+ Add some code to `src/app.js`
+ Run `npm start`

## What's next?

That is totally up to you.

+ Do you want to make an express app? `npm install --save express`
+ Not interested in Nodemon? `npm uninstall --save-dev nodemon`
+ Do you have a great idea for an app? Start hacking!
